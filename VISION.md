# Project Vision

## Vision Statement
_A short, compelling statement that encapsulates the project’s purpose._

In the future it will be all about models and those with the best models are going to have work available to them.

## Problem Statement
Description of the problem your project is addressing.

Companies have tons of data they can't leverage because it is too time consuming to do so. We can shrink the time to productize a speically trained model by orders of magnitude by templatizing and boiler-plating the components needed to set up and train smaller LLMs. These smaller models will be less good at general tasks, yet exceptional when tuned for specific tasks.

## Goals
- **Goal 1**: A clear objective.
- **Goal 2**: Another objective that aligns with the vision.

## Project Scope and Boundaries
Define the initial scope and boundaries to keep the project focused.

## Future Vision
An outline of the long-term plans for the project, including potential features or improvements.

## Audience
Who the project is for and who would benefit most from it.

## Values and Principles
(Optional) Any principles guiding the project’s development and goals.
